If that aim is met, the agreement will have been a significant step in an overall transition to OA, particularly in demonstrating a successful transition by a scholarly society. A key question that is as yet unanswered is whether a substantial number of other subscribers– particularly research-intensive universities– will adopt the model. If so, this Agreement will have been influential in providing a path to shift a key scholarly society fully to OA publication. The pilot does leave another question open as well: to what degree cost sustainability can be fostered through the model’s methods for incentivizing financial participation among low publishing output institutions."

Through this one-year stepping-stone agreement, Wiley can begin to ramp up its ability to support the multipayer model, described below, and make content at the five smaller UC campuses openly available, while maintaining a subscription model for the five larger UC campuses in the meantime. Assessment of this agreement, concurrent with negotiations for next year’s agreement, will help iterate on and improve the workflow implementation as we move to a wider agreement.
